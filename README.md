## Browser support

The app uses CSS grid so browser support is limited to modern browsers.

## Missing features

- The % button doesn't work.
- The +/- button doesn't work.
- The display doesn't have exponent capability. It is limited to 13 characters when typing, however a long number in the result isn't limited in character length.
- There is no AC (all clear) button, just C (clear) which clears everything.

## Notes

The project is bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA).
There's quite a few other little bugs but it works for most simple cases.
